SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
-----------------------------------------------------------

## PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide</br>
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation</br>
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and</br>
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership</br>
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and</br>
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The</br>
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, </br>
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved</br>
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,</br>
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The</br>
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply</br>
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

## DEFINITIONS
**"Font Software"** refers to the set of files released by the Copyright</br>
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may</br>
include source files, build scripts and documentation.</br>

**"Reserved Font Name"** refers to any names specified as such after the</br>
copyright statement(s).

**"Original Version"** refers to the collection of Font Software components as</br>
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

**"Modified Version"** refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,</br>
or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the</br>
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a</br>
new environment.

**"Author"** refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical</br>
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.
