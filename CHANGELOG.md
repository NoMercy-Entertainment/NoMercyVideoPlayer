# Changelog — @nomercy-entertainment/nomercy-video-player

## [2.0.0-rc.2] — 2026-06-14

### Changed

- The base event map is generic over the item type and emits the universal
  queue-item selection event.
- v1 `getCurrentSrc` and remaining `url` reads no longer cast now that `url` is a
  base field.

### Fixed

- Desktop-ui activity handling is de-duplicated.

### Removed

- Stale `./plugins/embed`, `./plugins/message`, and `./plugins/tab-leader`
  subpath exports that pointed at unbuilt files. These kit plugins remain
  available through the `./plugins` aggregate or directly from the core package.

## [2.0.0-beta.1] — 2026-05-30

### Changed

- Dependency on `@nomercy-entertainment/nomercy-player-core` changed from `file:` local
  path to `^2.0.0-beta.0` semver range — resolves correctly from the npm registry.
- `exports` map corrected: all directory-based plugins (`drm`, `embed`, `key-handler`,
  `live-transcoding`, `media-session`, `message`, `octopus`, `skipper`, `tab-leader`,
  `touch-zones`) now point to `./dist/plugins/<name>/index.js` matching tsc output layout.
- Build pipeline clarified as tsc-only; `vite.config.ts` and `vite.config.iife.ts` marked
  as non-publish reference files.
- `contributors` email updated to GitHub noreply address.

## [2.0.0-beta.0] — 2026-05-16

Rebuilt on `@nomercy-entertainment/nomercy-player-core` 2.0.0. The shared player
infrastructure (transport, queue, plugin runtime, auth, i18n, lifecycle) has moved into
the kit. All public API from v1.x is retained — import names are unchanged.

### Added

- `NMVideoPlayer` rebuilt as a mixin-composed class over the kit core
- `Html5VideoBackend` adapter — encapsulates all `<video>` element + HLS.js state;
  swappable via the kit's `stream` adapter port
- HDR-aware ABR: constrains HLS.js level selection to the active display's
  dynamic-range capability; updates live when the window moves to another monitor
- Plugin subpath exports: `./plugins/cast-sender`, `./plugins/desktop-ui`,
  `./plugins/drm`, `./plugins/embed`, `./plugins/key-handler`, `./plugins/live-transcoding`,
  `./plugins/media-session`, `./plugins/message`, `./plugins/octopus`, `./plugins/skipper`,
  `./plugins/subtitle-overlay`, `./plugins/tab-leader`, `./plugins/touch-zones`
- `desktop-ui` plugin: progressive breakpoint system, container queries, vertical playlist
  menu in portrait, double-tap touch seek, chapter buttons, dialog overlay redesign,
  in-popup mute button
- `touch-zones` plugin: debounced controlsVisible state machine, double-tap seek,
  center-tap toggles playback regardless of controls state
- `tv-ui` plugin: TV remote color-button + universal media-key bindings
- `auto-advance` plugin
- `subtitle-overlay` adapter with container-relative sizing and a11y clamp
- `vtt-chapters` and `vtt-sprite` adapters
- `subtitle-style-store` adapter
- `video-backend` adapter port (`./dist/player/video-backend/`)
- HLS.js is now a peer dependency (optional) — ESM-only build, no CJS/UMD outputs
- `sideEffects: false` — full tree-shaking support

### Fixed (from 1.2.7 work, carried into 2.0.0)
- HLS: stale instance destroyed before creating a new one on stream switch
- `resolveUrl` consults `imageBasePath` for poster/cast categories
- MediaSession seeds metadata from existing current item on plugin `use()`
- `currentEpoch` serializes `current()` autoplay to prevent stale loads on rapid
  episode switches
- `load()` rejects on fatal HLS errors before metadata arrives
- Poster applied synchronously to eliminate black-frame gap on source change
- `10s` hard timeout on `waitForLoadedMetadata` to unblock stuck HLS pipelines

### Breaking Changes (v1 → v2)

## [1.0.0-beta series] — 2026-02-28 → 2026-03-07

A series of 28 pre-releases that collectively introduced the following breaking changes relative to 0.6.x.
All breaking changes have **deprecated shims** on the 1.x prototype unless noted.

### Breaking Changes (0.6.x → 1.0.0)

**Architecture**
- Monolithic `index.ts` split into focused mixin modules (`playback`, `volume`, `display`, `subtitles`, `audio`, `quality`, `chapters`, `skippers`, `playlist`, `dom`, `translations`, `events`, `ui-state`, `core`). Public API surface unchanged; internal imports no longer valid.

**Constructor / factory**
- Package default export is now a factory function `nmplayer(id?) => NMPlayer`, not a class. `new NoMercyPlayer(opts)` no longer works. Shim: cast player already handles both shapes in VideoPlayer.vue.

**`ready` event timing** (breaking, no shim)
- `ready` now fires immediately after `init()` (player API available), not on `durationchange` (media loaded). Consumers who used `ready` to know that duration was valid must now wait for `duration` event or check `getDuration()` after a `time` event.

**Removed events** (no shim)
- `back-button` — removed. Consumer code listening to this event receives nothing.
- `absolutePositionReady` — removed.
- `overlay` — removed.
- `nextClick` — removed.
- `controls` / `showControls` / `hideControls` — **deprecated forwarders re-emit these** from the new `active` event, so existing listeners continue to work.

**Renamed events** (deprecated aliases kept)
- `captionsList` → `subtitleList`
- `captionsChanged` → `subtitleChanged`
- `captionsChanging` → `subtitleChanging`
- `dynamicControls` → `interaction`
- `displayClick` → `player-click`
- `display-message` → `message`
- `remove-message` → `message-dismiss`

**Added events**
- `complete` — fires when a single item finishes (before `playlistComplete`)
- `player-dblclick`

**Getter/setter API unification** (old names kept as deprecated shims)
- All `get*` / `set*` / `current*` prefixes removed from the public API. Methods are now dual getter/setters: e.g. `volume()` to read, `volume(50)` to write.
- Renamed: `rewindVideo(t)` → `rewind(t)`, `forwardVideo(t)` → `forward(t)`
- Caption → subtitle renaming: `getCaptionsList` → `subtitles()`, `setCurrentCaption` → `subtitle(index)`, etc.

**Index convention change for subtitle and quality** (breaking when using raw indices)
- Subtitle: `subtitle(-1)` = Off (was: `setCurrentCaption(0)` = Off; index 0 meant Off, 1+ real tracks)
- Quality: `quality(-1)` = Auto (was: Auto prepended at index 0)
- Deprecated shims `getCurrentQuality()` and `setCurrentQuality()` translate the old convention automatically.

**Methods without deprecated shims** (cast-player uses these)
- `getAudioTrack()` → use `audioTrackIndex()`
- `getSubtitleTrack()` → use `subtitleIndex()`
- `getSubtitleTracks()` → use `subtitles()`
- `setAudioTrack(id)` → use `audioTrack(index)`
- `setSubtitleTrack(id)` → use `subtitle(index)`
- `setQuality(id)` → use `quality(index)`
- `getActualQualityLabel()` → not exposed; no equivalent; quality label is in `qualityLevels()[index].label`
- `getAutoSkipChapters()` / `setAutoSkipChapters()` → not in video-player API at any version (was a UI-layer concept in old cast receiver)
- `getCurrentChapter()` with no args → shim exists but now requires `currentTime: number`; zero-arg call returns `undefined`

**`PlaylistItem` shape**
- Fields `subtitle`, `backdrop`, `resumeFromMs`, `overview` are not part of the typed `PlaylistItem` interface. These are application-level extensions that consumers add via the generic `T` parameter on `NMPlayer<T>`. The cast player's `playlistItem()` call relies on these fields being present — they will be if the playlist was loaded with items that include them, but TypeScript won't see them without the generic.

## [0.6.10] — baseline (cast-player pin)

Last 0.x release before the 1.0 rewrite. See git history for individual 0.x changes.
